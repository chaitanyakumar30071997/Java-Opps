1. What is Inheritance in Java?
Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where one class acquires the properties  and behaviors  use in another class. It is a way to reuse code and establish a relationship between parent and child classes.
Key Benefit: Code reusability. It promotes a hierarchical class structure where subclasses can build upon or override methods from a parent class.

2. Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from only one superclass.
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}
--> Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from another class, and that class may inherit from yet another class.
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
    void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing...");
    }
}

--> Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Meowing...");
    }
}
--> Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces): Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance directly (i.e., a class can’t extend more than one class), but it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

interface Mammal {
    void walk();
}

class Dog implements Animal, Mammal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }

    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Walking on four legs");
    }
}

*** 3. How does Inheritance work in Java?
The subclass inherits non-private members (fields and methods) from the superclass.
If a subclass wants to use or modify a superclass method, it can:
Override the method (if it's not final, static, or private).
Use the super keyword to call a method or constructor of the superclass.
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void eat() {
        super.eat();  // Calls the parent class's eat() method
        System.out.println("Dog is eating...");
    }
}


When discussing Inheritance in Java in an interview, you’ll likely need to cover several aspects. Here’s a breakdown of the key points, along with what you should be prepared to answer or explain:

1. What is Inheritance in Java?
Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class. It is a way to reuse code and establish a relationship between parent and child classes.
Key Benefit: Code reusability. It promotes a hierarchical class structure where subclasses can build upon or override methods from a parent class.
2. Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from only one superclass.

java
Copy
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}
Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from another class, and that class may inherit from yet another class.

java
Copy
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
    void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing...");
    }
}
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.

java
Copy
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Meowing...");
    }
}
Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces): Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance directly (i.e., a class can’t extend more than one class), but it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.

java
Copy
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

interface Mammal {
    void walk();
}

class Dog implements Animal, Mammal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }

    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Walking on four legs");
    }
}
3. How does Inheritance work in Java?
The subclass inherits non-private members (fields and methods) from the superclass.
If a subclass wants to use or modify a superclass method, it can:
Override the method (if it's not final, static, or private).
Use the super keyword to call a method or constructor of the superclass.
Example:
java
Copy
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void eat() {
        super.eat();  // Calls the parent class's eat() method
        System.out.println("Dog is eating...");
    }
}
*** 4. What is the super keyword in Inheritance?
The super keyword refers to the immediate parent class. It can be used to:

Call a superclass constructor.
Access superclass methods.
Access superclass fields (if they are not hidden by the subclass)

class Animal {
    Animal() {
        System.out.println("Animal constructor");
    }
    
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        super();  // Calls the constructor of Animal
        System.out.println("Dog constructor");
    }

    @Override
    void sound() {
        super.sound();  // Calls the sound() method of Animal
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

5. What are the advantages of using inheritance?
Code Reusability: A subclass can reuse the methods and fields of the superclass, reducing redundancy.
Method Overriding: A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method inherited from the superclass.
Extensibility: New classes can be easily added without modifying existing code.

6. What are the disadvantages or challenges of inheritance?
Tight Coupling: A subclass is tightly coupled with its superclass, which can cause maintenance problems if the superclass is modified.
Method Overriding Complexity: If a subclass overrides too many methods, it may become difficult to track which methods belong to which class.
Inheritance Limitation: Java does not support multiple inheritance directly, which can limit the flexibility of the inheritance model (though interfaces help solve this issue).

7. Can you override the constructor in Java?
No, constructors cannot be overridden in Java. However, constructors from the parent class can be called using the super() keyword.
The constructor is not inherited by the child class, but the child class can call the parent class constructor to initialize its inherited fields.

8. When should you use inheritance?
You should use inheritance when there is a clear "is-a" relationship between the subclass and superclass. For example, "Dog is an Animal" is a perfect example of inheritance. Avoid using inheritance in situations where a "has-a" or "uses-a" relationship exists, as composition might be more appropriate.

9. Example of method overriding with inheritance
Overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass
